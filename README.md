  - Buffer Size: Adjust for optimal copying speed (1-1024 KB)
  - Max Threads: Control concurrent operations (1-8 threads)
  
- **Behavior Settings:**
  - File Exists Policy: Choose how to handle duplicate files
  
- **Appearance Settings:**
  - Theme: Select between dark, light, or system theme

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Double-click folder** in File Explorer to navigate
- **Double-click task** to pause/resume individual operation
- **Ctrl+A equivalent** using "Select All" button
- **Search as you type** in the search field

## File Management

The application creates several files for persistent storage:
- `settings.json` - User preferences and configuration
- `file_cache.json` - Cached file information for faster browsing
- `copy_log.txt` - Detailed operation logs

## System Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Windows/Linux/macOS** (cross-platform)
- **Minimum 4GB RAM** recommended
- **CustomTkinter library**

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:
- **File permission errors** are logged and displayed
- **Network interruptions** are handled gracefully
- **Invalid paths** are validated before operations
- **Partial failures** don't stop other tasks

## Performance Tips

1. **Adjust buffer size** based on your storage type:
   - SSDs: 256-512 KB
   - HDDs: 64-128 KB
   - Network drives: 32-64 KB

2. **Optimize thread count**:
   - Local copies: 2-4 threads
   - Network copies: 1-2 threads
   - Mixed operations: 3-6 threads

3. **Use file filtering** to reduce memory usage with large directories

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start:**
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Install required dependencies: `pip install customtkinter`

**Slow copying performance:**
- Reduce buffer size for network operations
- Decrease thread count for mechanical drives
- Check available disk space

**UI appears broken:**
- Update CustomTkinter: `pip install --upgrade customtkinter`
- Reset settings by deleting `settings.json`

**Files not appearing:**
- Check directory permissions
- Refresh the file list manually
- Clear and rebuild the file cache
